## What is it?
Nekowin is a simple OpenGL and Vulkan compatible context window / surface library designed to work on GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems. 
It also has an ability to manage input devices and events.

## Building
Project files for nekowin can be generated using premake5 and compiled using your favourite C/C++ compiler. By default premake5 configures the project to build libnwin library along with OpenGL test application.
If no test application is needed `--no-test-apps` flag can be used. For more additional information use `premake5 --help`.
